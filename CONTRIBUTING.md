# Contributing

Awesome!  We love contributions.  There are just a few guidelines:

## Fixing a bug / adding a feature

Tests, documentation, etc. are awesome.  Just make sure that you are not breaking any current functionality with your changes.

Submit a pull request with a reference to the issue you are fixing, or describe why your new feature is awesome and how we can try it out.

### Code Conventions

Basically, just try to make your code looks like it fits in.  Two spaces for indentation, no tabs, and as many helpful comments as is necessary to read your code.

## Creating new issues

First, do a quick search to make sure that the issue has not been submitted before.

If not, please be as descriptive as possible in the issue, and provide steps to reproduce the issue that is being experience.  This makes it much quicker and easier to fix!
